# How-do-I-give-change
A short program I adapted from a homework assignment for Harvard open courseware's CS50x course.

The original assignment was to create a program in C that returned the minimum number of coins needed to make change. In this version, I modified my original script to return the exact quantities of each type of coin needed to make change as well as some additional instructions.
